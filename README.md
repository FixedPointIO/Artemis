# ARTEMIS

**ARTEMIS** (Advanced Regression and Tree Estimation Model for Integrated Silviology) is a Python package developed for research and applications in forestry statistics. This tool utilises modern optimisation techniques to derive the Chapman-Richards growth function, addressing the challenges presented by forestry data that may contain noise or outliers.

## Features

- **Growth Function through Evolutionary Optimisation**: ARTEMIS employs evolutionary algorithms to optimise the parameters of the Chapman-Richards function, aiming for an accurate representation of tree and forest growth metrics.
- **Data Refinement**: Contains scripts for the thorough processing and refinement of forestry datasets.
- **Optimisation Techniques**: Incorporates Nevergrad, an advanced optimisation library, to refine growth model parameters, particularly in the presence of noisy data.
- **Prior Knowledge Integration**: ARTEMIS facilitates the inclusion of prior information, sourced from academic literature or other authoritative sources. This aids in shaping the model's search space based on established data, ensuring a well-informed optimisation process.

## Incorporating Priors for Parameter Ranges

ARTEMIS provides a mechanism for users to integrate prior knowledge, termed as "priors", into the optimisation process. This becomes essential when there's academic backing or established data for certain parameter values. By doing so, the optimisation aligns more closely with known insights, which is pivotal in forestry statistics where data may be susceptible to inconsistencies.

To integrate priors in ARTEMIS, one needs to define the bounds for each parameter, complemented by the range informed by prior knowledge. This combination ensures that the optimisation is both grounded in domain expertise and statistically robust.

## Intelligent Optimisation

Forestry statistics, a key area within applied statistics, presents its own set of complexities, especially when modelling intricate systems or handling datasets lacking comprehensive quantitative information. In this context, the need arises for adaptable algorithm selection tools. NGOpt, part of the Nevergrad optimisation platform, is noteworthy due to its rigorous development and refinement process.

Incorporating NGOpt into ARTEMIS provides the tool with a robust foundation, ensuring that its optimisation methods are in line with proven strategies, all while addressing the multifaceted challenges of forestry statistics. ARTEMIS's use of evolutionary algorithms further underlines its methodical approach to parameter optimisation.
