# ARTEMIS

ARTEMIS (Advanced Regression and Tree Estimation Model for Integrated Silviology) is an advanced Python package designed for forestry statistics, bringing innovation to the field through the incorporation of the Chapman-Richards growth function and state-of-the-art optimization techniques. ARTEMIS offers a comprehensive suite of tools for estimating tree and forest growth variables, and it particularly excels in handling forestry data characterized by noise and spurious outliers. 

Developed by **FixedPoint IO Ltd** for **Climate Impact Partners**.

## Features

- **Chapman-Richards Growth Function**: Estimate tree and forest growth variables with high precision.
- **Data Cleaning**: Specialized scripts to process and clean forestry data.
- **Innovative Optimization**: Utilizes Nevergrad, a cutting-edge optimization library, to robustly fit growth model parameters to noisy forestry data.
