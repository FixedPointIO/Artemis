# Artemis: Advanced Forestry Statistics with the Chapman-Richards Growth Function

Artemis is an advanced Python package designed for forestry statistics, bringing innovation to the field through the incorporation of the Chapman-Richards growth function and state-of-the-art optimization techniques. Artemis offers a comprehensive suite of tools for estimating tree and forest growth variables, and it particularly excels in handling forestry data characterized by noise and spurious outliers. 

Developed by **FixedPoint IO Ltd** for **Climate Impact Partners**.

## Features

- **Chapman-Richards Growth Function**: Estimate tree and forest growth variables with high precision.
- **Data Cleaning**: Specialized scripts to process and clean forestry data.
- **Innovative Optimization**: Utilizes Nevergrad, a cutting-edge optimization library, to robustly fit growth model parameters to noisy forestry data.
